### About me

I am currently working on website design/management, web/mobile app development, ETL automation and data analysis projects for a variety of clients, while using my spare time to work on interesting Machine Learning projects (primarily in the life sciences/biomedical fields). I enjoy working on projects where I am unfamiliar with a framework/programming language, and can start from scratch by learning from team members - then do whatever it takes to catch up and make meaningful contributions. However, when feasible, I embrace the challenge of deep-diving and figuring it all out solo just as much. Likewise, I also enjoy sharing my expertise in the languages and tools I am well-versed in.
